### Readme - Source - Week 6 - Cordova

Cordova source code examples for week 6.

#### Notes
For Cordova source code examples, each app's `www` directory, `config.xml` file, and any associated custom files have been included.

To build and run these apps, you will need to create a standard Cordova project, and then exchange the default install directories for the custom examples.

e.g. create a new project, and then delete the default `www` directory. Then add the custom `www` directory from the app.

I've included the `config.xml` files for comparison. You may use them as a template, or simply create and modify your own.

Please check the weekly notes for required plugins for each app example.
