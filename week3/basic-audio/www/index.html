              She appeared as soloist with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland in 2001, where she performed the Brahms Violin Concerto. She opened the BBC Proms in 2005.

              She has eschewed tradition by recording with only five solo strings rather than an orchestra, including her brother as cellist and father playing continuo. In live concerts, she has received standing ovations from enthusiastic audiences, for example at the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra 2006 concert at Berlin's Waldbühne, with a full attendance of 25,000, and in Los Angeles at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in 2008 to a sold-out audience.

              Jansen has performed on the 1727 Stradivari "Barrere" violin, which was on loan from the Stradivari Society of Chicago, also the 1727 Stradivari "Baron Deurbroucq", which is owned by the Beare's International Violin Society. Jansen is currently in possession for 10 years of the 1707 Antonio Stradivari ‘Rivaz, Baron Gutmann’, which is owned by the Norwegian national bank's subsidiary: Dextra musica. She has begun her own chamber music festival in Utrecht. She has been a member of Spectrum Concerts Berlin since 1998.
